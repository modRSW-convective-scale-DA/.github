### Ensemble-based DA experiments with modified RSW models and their relevance for convective-scale NWP

This organization collects together a suite of models, assimilation algorithms, and assessment protocols for conducting idealised yet relevant experiments of convective-scale forecast-assimilation systems. Each repo contains a code base and documentation that describes the research in detail. These projects were carried out at the University of Leeds in collaboration with the Met Office. 

Please get in touch with the authors if you have any questions or comments!
